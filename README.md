## Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Highlight

I used a combination of React ref + useEffect + "mousedown" event listener to detect clicks outside the Social Media share links Popup.

So whenever you open the popup by clicking the share icon, you can click outside to close it.

## Running the project

`npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Deploying the project

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

The app is ready to be deployed.
